Write a function that takes in a string and determines if it's a palindrome or not. Return `true` if the string is a palindrome and return `false` if it isn't.

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as `'madam'` or `'racecar'` or the number `10801`.
